# J-SAP 
### ERP-type Java application with graphical user interface.

## Purpose
### J-SAP was created in order to pass a CS subject. Simulates ERP application like SAP, of course - with a very basic stuff. 

## Technology and Requirements
### Application has been written in Java, without any additional frameworks and tools like Gradle, Maven or Ant. I had to implement:
### * Graphical user interface (Swing),
### * Network communication, server-client architecture,
### * Java multithreading,
### * Interface and lambda expressions,

## How to work with J-SAP
#### To Log-in into J-SAP, you need to enter "admin" in both login and password textfields. After that, you go into main frame with some functionality. You need to write a correct 6-char product's code in order to find data from table (data are loaded from .csv file instead of SQL for passing subject conditions). If you write "111111", then you get special data (easter egg).

## Future Support
#### Program provides very good base for future development. If I have enough time in the future, the app will be surely updated with new and more sophisticated additions, although desktop apps are nowadays a little bit outdated and personally I'm into Data Science field with Python, therefore first push can be the last ;)
